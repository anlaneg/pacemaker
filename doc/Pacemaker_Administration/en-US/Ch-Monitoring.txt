= Monitoring a Pacemaker Cluster =

== Using crm_mon ==

The `crm_mon` utility displays the current state of an active cluster. It can
show the cluster status organized by node or by resource, and can be used in
either single-shot or dynamically updating mode. It can also display operations
performed and information about failures.

Using this tool, you can examine the state of the cluster for irregularities,
and see how it responds when you cause or simulate failures.

See the manual page or the output of `crm_mon --help` for a full description of
its many options.

As mentioned in an earlier chapter, the DC is the node is where decisions are
made. The cluster elects a node to be DC as needed. The only significance of
the choice of DC to an administrator is the fact that its logs will have the
most information about why decisions were made.
