== The Scope of this Document ==

This document is intended to be an exhaustive reference for
configuring Pacemaker.

To achieve this, it focuses on the XML syntax used to configure the CIB.
For those that are allergic to XML, multiple higher-level front-ends
(both command-line and GUI) are available. These tools will not be covered at
all in this document
footnote:[
I hope, however, that the concepts explained here make the functionality of
these tools more easily understood.
