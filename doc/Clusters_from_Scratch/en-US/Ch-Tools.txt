== Simplify administration using a cluster shell ==

In the dark past, configuring Pacemaker required the administrator to
read and write XML.  In true UNIX style, there were also a number of
different commands that specialized in different aspects of querying
and updating the cluster.

All of that has been greatly simplified with the creation of unified
command-line shells (and GUIs) that hide all the messy XML
scaffolding.

These shells take all the individual aspects required for managing and
configuring a cluster, and pack them into one simple-to-use command
line tool.

They even allow you to queue up several changes at once and commit
them all at once.

Two popular command-line shells are `pcs` and
`crmsh`.  This edition of Clusters from Scratch is based on `pcs`.

[NOTE]
===========
The two shells share many concepts but the scope, layout and syntax
does differ, so make sure you read the version of this guide that
corresponds to the software installed on your system.

== Explore pcs ==

Start by taking some time to familiarize yourself with
what `pcs` can do.

----
[root@pcmk-1 ~]# pcs

Usage: pcs [-f file] [-h] [commands]...
Control and configure pacemaker and corosync.

Options:
    -h, --help         Display usage and exit.
    -f file            Perform actions on file instead of active CIB.
    --debug            Print all network traffic and external commands run.
    --version          Print pcs version information.
    --request-timeout  Timeout for each outgoing request to another node in
                       seconds. Default is 60s.

Commands:
    cluster     Configure cluster options and nodes.
    resource    Manage cluster resources.
    stonith     Manage fence devices.
    constraint  Manage resource constraints.
    property    Manage pacemaker properties.
    acl         Manage pacemaker access control lists.
    qdevice     Manage quorum device provider on the local host.
    quorum      Manage cluster quorum settings.
    booth       Manage booth (cluster ticket manager).
    status      View cluster status.
    config      View and manage cluster configuration.
    pcsd        Manage pcs daemon.
    node        Manage cluster nodes.
    alert       Manage pacemaker alerts.

As you can see, the different aspects of cluster management are separated
into categories. To discover the functionality available in each of these
categories, one can issue the command +pcs pass:[<replaceable>category</replaceable>] help+.  Below
is an example of all the options available under the status category.

----
[root@pcmk-1 ~]# pcs status help

Usage: pcs status [commands]...
View current cluster and resource status
Commands:
    [status] [--full | --hide-inactive]
        View all information about the cluster and resources (--full provides
        more details, --hide-inactive hides inactive resources).

    resources [<resource id> | --full | --groups | --hide-inactive]
        Show all currently configured resources or if a resource is specified
        show the options for the configured resource.  If --full is specified,
        all configured resource options will be displayed.  If --groups is
        specified, only show groups (and their resources).  If --hide-inactive
        is specified, only show active resources.

    groups
        View currently configured groups and their resources.

    cluster
        View current cluster status.

    corosync
        View current membership information as seen by corosync.

    quorum
        View current quorum status.

    qdevice <device model> [--full] [<cluster name>]
        Show runtime status of specified model of quorum device provider.  Using
        --full will give more detailed output.  If <cluster name> is specified,
        only information about the specified cluster will be displayed.

    nodes [corosync | both | config]
        View current status of nodes from pacemaker. If 'corosync' is
        specified, view current status of nodes from corosync instead. If
        'both' is specified, view current status of nodes from both corosync &
        pacemaker. If 'config' is specified, print nodes from corosync &
        pacemaker configuration.

    pcsd [<node>]...
        Show current status of pcsd on nodes specified, or on all nodes
        configured in the local cluster if no nodes are specified.

    xml
        View xml version of status (output from crm_mon -r -1 -X).

Additionally, if you are interested in the version and
supported cluster stack(s) available with your Pacemaker
installation, run:
